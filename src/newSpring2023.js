				"The scope of this course begins amidst the devastation and geopolitical shifts that followed World War II and ends with the effects of globalization in the 1990s and 2000s. We will ask the same questions that faced artists and critics in between: Should art focus on its own material processes or open its borders to historical flux? Is it art's job to create the cultural myths that bind society together, or to deconstruct them? Who participates in modern and contemporary art, and who doesn't? What kinds of production should be considered art? How are specific formal strategies informed by the perspectives of different subject positions? What politics underwrite them? We will consider, and reconsider, the existing narratives about art during this period with a dual aim: first, to better understand the historical positions of the artists in question, and, second, to piece together a prehistory of the moment in which we currently find ourselves.",

Modes of natural climate variability, which include El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), will then be described, as will the statistical techniques used to reveal them. Statistical prediction models based on multivariate regressions often incorporate index-representations of ENSO and other relevant variables. Accordingly, we will devote some time and exercises on methods in which these models are developed as well as tested. Dynamical models are also used for climate prediction, but require computational capability and relatively more thought in design and application. Thus, we will complete the course with a significant treatment of global models as well as regional models. Both models are based on the same basic set of equations, but typically have different applications. Model setup and implementation will be illustrated through practical exercises with open-source community global and regional models. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

				"Biomedical image data often come in extreme numbers: there is either so many of them that humans can't analyze them in reasonable time (e.g., three-dimensional light sheet microscopy data) or they are few, highly varied and of limited spatial and intensity resolutions (e.g., positron emission tomography scans). Furthermore, the extraction of image features and the characterization of modality-dependent background noise can be particularly challenging in typical biomedical scenarios. In this course, several applications of statistical learning to biomedical image data will be covered in depth from first principles. Analyses will be done in Python using the Scikit-learn package and all homework assignments comprise statistical analyses of biomedical image data in real decision scenarios. Histogram transforms and the fundamental properties of image texture will be introduced and revisited throughout the course. The extraction of both low- and high-order spatial features at multiple scales will be demonstrated and employed throughout the course. Support vector machines will be introduced and applied to image classification and interpretation tasks. The random forest algorithm will be introduced and used on a number of large- and small-data tasks. Multiple linear regression will be applied to neuroimaging data and some common methods of assessing model robustness shown. Cross-validation of image-derived decisions and some common methods of assessing model robustness will be shown. Feature selection and dimensionality will be discussed in terms of diagnostic task performance. The effects of inter-feature correlation upon prediction confidence will be discussed. Principal component analysis will be described and applied to various image processing tasks. Unsupervised clustering and cluster analysis of extracted image features will be introduced. Stochastic object models will be introduced and applied in various validation tasks. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: BIOE 485 or permission of the instructor. Students are expected to be familiar with calculus, basic probability & sampling, vector spaces, matrix algebra and constrained optimization. Several NumPy objects and manipulations will be reviewed, and all necessary Sci-kit functions introduced; however, students are expected to have substantial experience with Python programming as the basics of such will not be covered.",

The range of texts we thus characterize as "early British literature" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

This course will explore how fictional texts articulated the problems of nineteenth-century democracy, including the crises over slavery leading to the Civil War, and the rise of large-scale capitalism and urban modernity later in the century. We will look at such literary movements as sentimentalism, sensationalism, realism, and naturalism, among others. Writers studied might include Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry James, Charles Chesnutt, Mark Twain, Pauline Hopkins, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, and many others.

At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text\'s moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the "African-ness" and "American-ness" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons\u2014philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental\u2014and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization.

Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debates is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment.

			description:
				'Addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: "what is this about?" (reference); "who or what is doing this?" (agency); "what holds this together?" (structure); "how does this fit with its surroundings?" (context); and "what is this for?" (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. "Transposition" refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of "the language turn" which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century. In a practical sense, semiotics of the kind explored in this course also provides tools for reading and interpreting multimodal texts and research data. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.',

Although data mining has its roots in database management, it has grown into a discipline that focuses on algorithm design (to ensure computational feasibility) & statistical modeling (to separate the signal from the noise). It draws heavily upon a variety of other disciplines including statistics, machine learning, operations research, & information retrieval. Will cover the major data mining concepts, principles, & techniques that every information scientist should know about. Lectures will introduce & discuss the major approaches to data mining; computer lab sessions coupled w/assignments will provide hands-on experience with these approaches; term projects offer the opportunity to use data mining in a novel way.

				'MACS 282 offers a deep dive into the phenomenon of the Horror Movie. Through the semester we will explore the enduring fascination with the act of scaring one\u2019s self in public. Our class\u2019 first section will discuss tendencies within the narrative itself, the frequent stylistic flourishes deployed by its storytellers and the subtexts these experiences inevitably articulate. The next section will visit a few of the many discourses addressed by the Horror Movie while noting some of the reoccurring themes and motifs that emerge and intersect across the films we will screen. Finally, the Semester will close with a consideration of the Horror Spectacle: the tactics these pictures utilize to keep audiences in seats and eyes on the screen. Through the coming weeks we will discuss the social, political and cultural implications of the Horror Movie\u2019s expressions of gender, sexuality, race, religion, science, and philosophy.',

We will explore this new digital realm and discuss its revolutionary impact upon both firms and consumers. This exploration comes in two parts. In the first part (the first four weeks), we will explore how the digital revolution has affected our analog (or physical) world. Specifically, we will examine four ways in which the Analog World has been affected by the Digital Revolution: Domination, Resistance, Synergy, and Transformation. In the second part (the second four weeks), we will review the foundations of marketing (i.e., product, promotion, placement, and price) and examine how these foundations are being shifted by the rise of the digital revolution. In this portion of the course, we will explore a variety of new digital concepts and tools, including, customer co-creation, user-generated content, and 3D printing. This course will contain several examples of each of these concepts and explore their implications for both marketers and consumers. This course will also employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises, and interviews with leading marketing scholars. The learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and be a member of a rich learning community. I hope you will join us in this educational adventure. Please note that this is not an e-commerce class. We will not examine social media analytics, search engine optimization, or other digital marketing tactics. The other courses in our Digital Marketing Specialization will cover these topics in considerable detail. Instead, this course is broader in focus and more strategic in orientation. 4 graduate hours.

What are the constraints that narrative form, production routines, financing and distribution put on representing environmental problems and environmentalists? Is the information in the film to be trusted? In documentaries, are physical and social scientists\u2019 explanations of environmental problems and solutions reliable? What cues can we use from within and outside the film to evaluate the film for credibility? During the course participants will compare the science and economics of selected environmental issues with film presentations, examine what drives of environmental participation (and the limits of film in presenting science), and look at the constraints of producing special interest versus broad distribution films on presentations of the environment.

				"In this course, we seek to make sense of the impacts of globalization. Is the freer flow of trade, people, and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic, social, and political ills, or are we inclined to say that, on balance, it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways, are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share, or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social, cultural, political, and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.
